<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>Growing up I was always active in a multitude of sports such as Soccer and Track. However, I was always down for a pick game of anything. <br/>
I had a love for golf as a kid, but we could never afford a good set of clubs, let alone the green fees just to play. I then was looking<br/>
for a good summer job and a friend recommended that I come caddie with him. Long story short, I fell in love with the game. After learning<br/>
how to caddie, I went every day for 5 summers straight. It wasn't until then that I was finally able to afford a set of clubs. However, my<br>
one true love was always soccer.I loved watching, playing, and talking about soccer any chance I could. I would, and still watch the Premier<br>
League or any of the top 5 leagues when I can.</p><br><br/>

<p>I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, and loved it, but it was time for me to move on. You may be wondering what a kid from Chicago <br />
knows about the country of Denmark. With that being said in 2021, I married the love of my life. She was an Au Pair from the port town of<br />
Fredericia on the western peninsula of Jutland. I had been to Germany before, but I always wanted to go to other European countries, but<br/>
I didn't know much about them.We had moved from Georgia to Texas and then to Hawaii before we could even think about going to Denmark. <br/>
Then for Christmas in 2023, we were able to make the journey. After 24 hours of flying from Hawaii to Denmark, we finally reached our new<br/>
home for a month. I was so excited to meet my new family I hadn't met before, and to be back in Europe. We landed, and it was such a relief <br/>
  to walk outside and wear a winter jacket and see snow again! I have attached two of my favorite pictures of our most recent trip to Denmark.</p><br/>

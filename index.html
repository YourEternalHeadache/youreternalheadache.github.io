<b><h2>Welcome to my page about Denmark!</h2></b>
    I plan to set my page up like this...

    <h3>Food</h3><br>
    <h3>Geography</h3><br>
    <h3>Notable People</h3><br>

<h4> About Me</h4>
  <p>Growing up I was always active in a multitude of sports such as Soccer and Track. However, I was always down for a pick game of anything. <br/>
       I had a love for golf as a kid, but we could never afford a good set of clubs, let alone the green fees just to play. <br/>
       I then was looking for a good summer job and a friend recommended that I come caddy with him. Long story short, I fell in love with the game. <br/>
       After learning how to caddie, I went every day for 5 summers straight. It wasn't until then that I was finally able to afford a set of clubs. However, my one true love was always soccer. <br/>
       I loved watching, playing, and talking about soccer any chance I could. I would, and still watch the Premier League or any of the top 5 leagues when I can. </p><br>

  <p>I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, and loved it, but it was time for me to move on.<br/>
       You may be wondering what a kid from Chicago knows about the country of Denmark. With that being said in 2021, I married the love of my life. <br/>
       She was an Au Pair from the port town of Fredericia on the western peninsula of Jutland. I had been to Germany before, but I always wanted to go to other European countries, but I didn't know much about them. <br/>
       We had moved from Georgia to Texas and then to Hawaii before we could even think about going to Denmark. Then for Christmas in 2023, we were able to make the journey. <br/>
       After 24 hours of flying from Hawaii to Denmark, we finally reached our new home for a month. I was so excited to meet my new family I hadn't met before, and to be back in Europe. <br/>
       We landed, and it was such a relief to walk outside and wear a winter jacket and see snow again! I have attached two of my favorite pictures of our most recent trip to Denmark. <br/> </p>

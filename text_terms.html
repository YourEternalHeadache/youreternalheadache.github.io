<h2>The Daily life of Danes</h2>
<p>Most people have heard that the Scandinavia is home to some of the happiest people in the world! But, if you have
been to any of those countries they can be cold, grey, and sometimes bland. Doesn't sound like somewhere that would be
one of the happiest places on earth right? The 2020 World Happiness Report said: "Denmark has been ranked as the second
happiest country in the world, and Aarhus itself was ranked as the worlds's seconds happiest city..." (2024). Many
different things go into making a group of people happy but in Denmark, you can see how happy people are anywhere you
go!</p>

<p>Danish people are some of the most welcoming and happy individuls I have ever met. There are a lot of things that
do differently. For example, babies are left outside while they are sleeping, even during the cold winters. It is not
uncommon to be walking around a busy city center and see babies outside, in their strollers, while their parents are
inside eating dinner or ordering a warm cup of coffee.</p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself: "Aren't the parents worried about someone walking off with their baby?" Most danes
do not consider this a possibility because Denmark is one of the safest countries in the world. In an article published
by Aarhus University, "Denmark is a safe and secure country with a very low crime rate. In addition to this, Denmark is
one of the least corrupt countries in the world. There are high levels of social trust in Denmark, meaning Danes trust
their government and each other." (2024). It is a very different cultural dynamic that Danes have with one another. It
feels like you know everyone there and they have known you forever.</p>

<p>This sense of belonging or making others feel at home is what Danes know as "Hygge". There is no direct English
translation that can explain what Hygge actually is. According to Aahaus University, a Danish University, the say that
"the concept of "hygge" - being cosy and making people feel at home - is an essential part of life in Denmark. Hygge
promotes the idea of appreciating the small, simple, things in life - such as time with friends." (2024). To us
overwhelming hospitality seems to be a bit of a scarcity in the world but, every Dane exemplifies hygge daily.</p>

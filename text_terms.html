<h2>The Daily life of Danes</h2>
<img src="osterby.jpg" alt="osterby" height="30%" width="20%">
<p id="first">Most people have heard that the Scandinavia is home to some of the happiest people in the world! But, if you have
been to any of those countries they can be cold, grey, and sometimes bland. Doesn't sound like somewhere that would be
one of the happiest places on earth right? The 2020 World Happiness Report said: "Denmark has been ranked as the
second-happiest country in the world, and Aarhus itself was ranked as the worlds seconds happiest city..." (2024). Many
different things go into making a group of people happy but in Denmark, you can see how happy people are anywhere you
go! Many Danes joke that they attribute their happiness with the bleak and dreary weather. No matter the weather outside
you will see people riding their bikes places. I remember seeing people biking everywhere and thought that it was odd. I
saw people biking outside after it had snowed and the roads were covered in ice!</p>

<p id="second">Danish people are some of the most welcoming and happy individuals I have ever met. There are a lot of
things that do differently. For example, babies are left outside while they are sleeping, even during the cold winters.
It is not uncommon to be walking around a busy city <img src="train_station.jpg" alt="Train station in Copenhagen" height="50%" width="15%"> center and see babies outside, in their strollers, while their
parents are inside eating dinner or ordering a warm cup of coffee. You might be thinking to yourself: "Aren't the
parents worried about someone walking off with their baby?" Most danes do not consider this a possibility because
Denmark is one of the safest countries in the world. In an article published by Aarhus University, "Denmark is a safe
and secure country with a very low crime rate. In addition to this, Denmark is one of the least corrupt countries in the
world. There are high levels of social trust in Denmark, meaning Danes trust their government and each other." (2024).
It is a very different cultural dynamic that Danes have with one another. It feels like you know everyone there and that
they have known you forever.</p>
<p id="third">This sense of belonging or making others feel at home is what Danes know as "Hygge". There is no direct
English translation that can explain what Hygge actually is. According to Aahaus University, a Danish University, the
say that "the concept of "hygge" - being cosy and making people feel at home - is an essential part of life in Denmark. 3
Hygge promotes the idea of appreciating the small, simple, things in life - such as time with friends." (2024). To us
overwhelming hospitality seems to be a bit of a scarcity in the world but, every Dane exemplifies hygge daily. Danes are
very passionate about being Danish and, they love their flag. Did you know that the Danish Dannebrog is the oldest flag
still in use? The Dannebrog was said had "fell from the sky during a battle lead by Valdemar, the second king of Denmark
in Estonia." (2022). The Danish flag to Danes symbolizes "Hygge". It is normal to see flags for birthdays, weddings, or
something as simple as picking someone up from the airport.</p>
